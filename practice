Intro to JavaScript

1. Variables and Data Types
Variables store data and are declared using:
var (older, function-scoped)
let (block-scoped, preferred)
const (for values that donâ€™t change)


var name = 'John';
let name = 'John';
const name = 'John';
Data types in JavaScript include:
Primitive Types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
Non-Primitive Types: Objects, Arrays, Functions
