Intro to JavaScript

1. Variables and Data Types
Variables store data and are declared using:
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

1. Automatically
2. var (older, function-scoped)
3. let (block-scoped, preferred)
4. const (for values that donâ€™t change)


var name = 'John';
let name = 'John';
const name = 'John';
Data types in JavaScript include:
Primitive Types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
Non-Primitive Types: Objects, Arrays, Functions

More Example: 
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

const x = 5;
const y = 6;
const z = x + y;

Mixed Example
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;

Constant Objects and Arrays
The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this you can NOT:

Reassign a constant value
Reassign a constant array
Reassign a constant object
But you CAN:

Change the elements of constant array
Change the properties of constant object
Constant Arrays
You can change the elements of a constant array:
// You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");

But you can NOT reassign the array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR
